# NChat
Code name NChat is a utility app designed to allow its users to add friends to multiple subset groups of thier choosing.
Once those groups are made the user may set a alarm for a sleep or nap timer and a message will be sent to the group of thier choosing-
notifying them that the person is asleep.
This will be especially useful for students with noisy roommates, during exam time, night-shift workers or irregular hour work like nurses and doctors, people working in different time zones, etc.
This app will also contain a small section with facts about sleep and what makes it so important you a healthy lifestyle.

Down the road...:
In the future an ambition for this app is to include a sleep log built in and sleep tracker to monitor your sleeping habits and even set goals-
so someone can make sure they hit their target number of hours of sleep every night.
